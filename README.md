## About

### What is it

**download-from-link** is a program to download the mp4 file of any embedded video, for example, twitch clips. They do not provide a download button to download the clip so if you run **download-from-link** it will download the embedded video.

### How to use it

Download **download-from-link.exe** from the [latest release](https://github.com/Uvxtq/download-from-link/releases/latest) and preferably create a new folder and put the exe in there. Open a terminal and run: ```download-from-link.exe <link you want to download>``` (Make sure you are cd'ed into the directory with the exe!)

Also, make sure you have rust downloaded, you can download it from [rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
