## About

### What is it

**dfl-cli** is a program to download the mp4 file of any embedded video, for example, twitch clips. They do not provide a download button to download the clip so if you run **dfl-cli** it will download the embedded video.

### How to use it

Download **dfl-cli.exe** from the [latest release](https://github.com/Uvxtq/dfl-cli/releases/latest) and preferably create a new folder and put the exe in there. Open a terminal and run: ```dfl-cli.exe <link you want to download>``` (Make sure you are cd'ed into the directory with the exe!)

## Supported

Twitch: Clips and VODs.

## Soon To Be Added

Youtube: shorts, videos.

Also will be adding a mp3 arg to the downloader to download the mp3 instead.
